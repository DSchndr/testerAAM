Mercedes All Activity Module Cloning Tool

This is a Program which I found in the depths of the Internet.

It allows you to dump or write a AAM Module over K-Line using a cable like K+DCan.

# "My new Module still has issues"
The "automotive grade" motorola mcu slowly dies in that module too.

Overwriting it with 00's or FF's will probably show some stuck EEProm bits, switch the slots of the working keys to unused ones.

Or get another one and try your luck again :)

There are *no* replacement parts for it (china has some, but there are most likely fakes / relabled)
